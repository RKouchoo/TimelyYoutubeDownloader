# TimelyYoutubeDownloader
A Timely downloader for youtube. looks though your subs and downloads their latest video, which can be synced to your phone via ADB

# Usage
Download the subscriptions RSS file from https://www.youtube.com/subscription_manager and drop it in "db/" as subscriptionsExport.xml (I left my own for demo purposes).

When adding a new RSS file be sure to delete all the files in the cache folder as the program needs to make a new index for all of your subscriptions. Feel free to make backups incase the something happens during the download process

# Issues:

- project dead??
- ADB not implemented...
- No guide on usage
